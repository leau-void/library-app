This is a Library App I made as part of The Odin Project's JS full-stack path.

In this project I practiced using objects, object constructors, prototypes, Web Storage API, array methods, and more.

I think I learned a lot with this project, but I think the code needs lots of improvement, especially trying to make the function placement more adequate, and not having them all on the global scope. I also want to learn and practice the use of factory functions in the place of constructors, and how to use returned functions.
